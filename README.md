# 20-Solidity

* Level One is an [AssociateProfitSplitter](https://github.com/arzuisiktopbas/20-Solidity/blob/main/AssociateProfitSplitter.sol) contract. This accepts Ether into the contract and divides the Ether evenly among the associate level employees. This allows the Human Resources department to pay employees quickly and efficiently.

* Level Two is a [TieredProfitSplitter](https://github.com/arzuisiktopbas/20-Solidity/blob/main/TieredProfitSplitter.sol) that distributes different percentages of incoming Ether to employees at different tiers/levels. For example, the CEO gets paid 60%, CTO 25%, and Bob gets 15%.
